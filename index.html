						<h2>Testimonials</h2>
					</header>
					<section class="testimonials">
						<blockquote>I had the pleasure of managing Jason at Pando. Jason is a great full-stack engineer who I have seen grow immensely over the past year. Jason came to Pando after graduating from App Academy with a strong appetite to learn and grow. He quickly dove into our code and took ownership over his own learning journey. Along with being a valued and productive coder, Jason became one of the best code reviewers on the team, because of his attention to detail and conscientiousness around edge cases. On top of that, Jason was a great team member -- our customer success team loved when he was the support engineer for the sprint, as Jason's calm and friendly demeanor was great to work with, and he ensured that customers knew when bugs would be fixed. I truly hope that Jason and I get to work together again soon!</blockquote>

						<blockquote>Jason is a calm, professional, and thorough engineer to work with. Having had the pleasure of working with Jason at Pando I can assure that Jason is the person you want reviewing your code. Jason and I shipped several features together and I learned so much about how attention to detail, thoughtfulness, and patience can really make a sprint feel so much more at ease. Jason is this engineer, and every team needs one. We are all so capable of learning frameworks and libraries - itâ€™s these intangibles that are rare and hard to find! Any team would be lucky to have you.</blockquote>

						<blockquote>Jason is a passionate and extremely talented engineer as well as a naturally gifted communicator and team-worker. Over the 1000+ hours I worked with him as his primary instructor at App Academy I was consistently impressed with how quickly he mastered new technologies and high-level software concepts. I have full confidence that he will be an asset to every team he works with during the course of his career and I would consider myself lucky to get to work with him again some day as a peer. He has my highest and most sincere recommendation!</blockquote>
